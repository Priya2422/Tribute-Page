            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p class="mainAbout">In a world filled with male rulers, characters, and other figures it is a very unique and distinctive thing to read about a woman who single-handedly and bravely fought for her kingdom, self-respect, husband and the People of her kingdom. She was born into a Marathi Brahmin family and her nickname was Manu. Her parents came from Maharashtra and had their linkage with Nana Sahib and it is said that they both were cousins. Her father Moro Pant Tambe vault in the court of Bithoor district for the Peshwa of Bithoor. Peshwa was an honest man and he brought up Manikarnika like his own daughter, given her gleeful, jovial, playful and notorious personality the Peshwa called her Chabeli, which means playful in English.  
            Just like others she was educated at home, during that time education was scarce and schools only allowed male participants so it became very hard for a girl child to obtain education in any manner but given Lakshmibai's background and the acceptance level of her parents, they were very supportive of her education. Manu was more independent in her childhood than any other child of that age, it is fascinating to know that her studies included activities such as shooting, horsemanship, fencing and Mala Khamba and she practised it with childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tantia Tope. Manikarnika had a very bold upbringing because her mother died when she was of four years and her father was left with a fierce child-like Manikarnika.      
                Manikarnika's own life has been very disruptive and filled with ups and downs, she was married to the maharaja of Jhansi, Raja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar in May 1842. She gave birth to a baby boy who was named Damodar Rao in 1851 but sadly he died four months after his birth, the maharaja then decided to adopt a child called Anand Rao who was the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, he was renamed Damodar Rao one day before the maharaja died. This period was a very crucial time because Damodar was adopted so the British East India Company, which during that time was under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the doctrine of lapse which basically rejected Damodar Rao’s claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories, when this news reached Lakshmibai she swore that she will not surrender Jhansi at any cost, her exact words were “I shall not surrender my Jhansi'' (Main meri Jhansi nahi doongi). The Rani Mahal, the palace of Rani Lakshmibai which is now converted into a museum, houses a collection of archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th centuries AD.</p>
